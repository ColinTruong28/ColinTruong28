## Welcome!

I am Colin Truong, a fullstack devloper interested in software devlopment, machine learning, and robotics! I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's in both Computer Science and Robotic Engineering.

âœ¨ I thoroughly enjoy project based learning and trying out new things! I have practical experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to begin web development, and Python (Kivy) with FireBase for app development, but recently I have really been enjoying using React, TypeScript, and Next.js to create my responsive and fluid web components. Outside of projects I have education in Java, C and C++ as well! âœ¨

ðŸ‘¯ When I am away from my desk I continue to be adventurous! Some of my favorite past-times include rock climbing, guitar, trying new foods, and driving aimlessly.

âš¡ My passion and drive is towards making an impact! Whether it's with the programs I create or simply putting myself out there to help my community in any way I can, I always strive to improve myself and those around me!
